<p>The annexation of Texas and the consequent war with Mexico
resulted in adding to the United States eight hundred and
eighty-six thousand four hundred and ninety square miles of
territory, an area much greater than all that is comprised in
the States lying east of the Mississippi River, and almost equal
to that embraced in the Louisiana purchase of President Jefferson
from Napoleon the First in 1803. The events of the war
which added and confirmed to the Union this magnificent
domain have been obscured by the magnitude of the recent
civil war, and they have become almost as remote in the
popular imagination as the romantic incidents in the campaigns
of Cortez in the sixteenth century. But as the fires
of civil strife are almost dead, and peaceful industries are developing
the wonderful resources of our Mexican acquisitions,
new interest is awakened in the circumstances of the conquest
and the brilliant military achievements that attended them.
By the enterprise of our own people millions of gold and silver
have been added to the world’s wealth from the mines and
placers of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, and
the plains of Texas are teeming with countless herds for the
feeding of Europe. A new but peaceful invasion of Mexico
by American capital has been begun, which arouses fresh
interest in its history, its native wealth, and its destiny. A
railway under American management traverses the line of
Scott’s march from Vera Cruz to the capital city, another will
soon pass over the fields made immortal by Taylor and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
handful of rough and ready soldiers; engineering skill proposes
to cross the Isthmus of Tehuantepec with an iron highway
for the transportation of ocean vessels from the Bay of
Campeche to the waters of the Pacific Ocean, and a line of
railway following the track of Doniphan’s march will soon
reach Chihuahua in its progress to the City of Mexico, being
built with a rapidity almost equal to the speed of his little
army of victorious Missourians who first marked out this pathway
of improvement.</p>

<p>The time has not yet come when the war with Mexico can
be treated with the philosophic dignity of which it is worthy,
embellished with the imagination of poetry, and its events
appropriated by the historical novelist. Certain it is, whether
strange or not, that no hand has been put forth to extract the
philosophy of its history, to direct our opinions of its events
and its men, to trace the connections of its causes and effects,
and to draw from its occurrences and results general lessons of
political wisdom. Almost all the histories and sketches of it
were written soon after its close, and may be considered almost
contemporaneous with it, when the authors of the period could
not avail themselves of the mass of material which time has
now made accessible. The party passions of the hour, intensified
by the slavery struggle, so tinged all efforts at the philosophical
discussion of it that its great, enduring, and far-reaching
consequences were not foreseen, much less appreciated, and
are only just now beginning to be felt under the influence of
the material development of the vast regions that were added
to the country at its termination. Numerous books have been
written about it, many of which will have some value to him
who shall in the future assume the task of illustrating this
brilliant period of American history, and there is appended to
this essay a list of those volumes which have been examined
and seem worthy of study. So little, however, is the history
of this portion of the nation’s life appreciated that President
Porter, of Yale College, in the list of historical studies in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
work upon “Books and Reading” omits all reference to works
upon the Mexican War, and gives but bare mention to that
valuable authority upon the subject, “Benton’s Thirty Years
View,” a work of which William Cullen Bryant has said: “Its
literary execution, the simplicity of its style, and the unexceptionable
taste which tempers all its author’s allusions to
his contemporaries have been the subject of universal admiration.”
For a clear and dispassionate discussion of the
causes of the war, for just judgment of the motives of the
actors in it, and the impartial statements of the facts that are
given, Col. Benton’s chapters on the Mexican War cannot
be commended too highly to the student or the historian. It
is worthy of mention that the chapter which contains his
address of welcome to Doniphan and the Missouri Volunteers
at St. Louis on their return from the war is a masterpiece of
dignified and graphic eloquence, worthy of a place as a classic
model, and calls to mind the days when Athens witnessed the
most splendid exhibitions of oratory the world has ever known.
Since most of the histories of this war have been written a
valuable addition has been made to the stores of knowledge on
the subject in an admirable translation by Col. Albert E.
Ramsey of a Mexican history of the conflict, which has been
published under the title, “The Other Side.”</p>

<p>For the limited purposes of this essay it will be sufficient to
select for rapid review those volumes which are esteemed the
best types of all that has been written, and present them for
consideration.</p>

<p class="p2 hang">THE WAR WITH MEXICO. By R. S. Ripley, Brevet-Major in the United States
Army, &amp;c. New York. 1849. 2 vols., 8vo.</p>
</div>

<p>This seems by all odds the best history of the Mexican War.
As a military history it is almost faultless, and will probably
remain an authority upon the military events of the war for all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
time. The author, who was born in Ohio, graduated from the
Military Academy in 1843. His regiment, the Second Artillery,
was sent to the Rio Grande, took part in the battles around
Monterey in September, 1846, and was then ordered to report
to Gen. Scott. In the reorganization of the forces he became
First Lieutenant of the Second Artillery, March 3, 1847.
He took part in the operations which ended in the capitulation
of Vera Cruz and the occupation of that port by the American
Army, (March 9 to 29, 1847,) and for gallant and meritorious
conduct in the battle of Cerro Gordo (April 17 and 18,
1847,) was breveted Captain. When Gen. Scott began his
final movement upon the City of Mexico (Aug. 6, 1847)
Ripley was assigned to duty as aide to Gen. Pillow, and
was with that General in the battles of Contreras, Churubusco,
and Molino del Rey, and also in the storming of Chapultepec,
and for his gallant and meritorious conduct was breveted
Major (Sept. 13, 1847). He was, therefore, an actor in most of
the scenes which he describes, and held towards the superior
officers of the Army relations which enabled him to comprehend
what was done.</p>

<p>As an aide-de-camp and friend of Gen. Pillow, he naturally
sympathized with that officer in the unseemly dissensions
which broke out between Gen. Scott on the one hand and
Gens. Worth and Pillow and other distinguished officers on the
other, and was more or less interested in the protracted
military investigations which followed the war. In this way
he made the military history of the war a careful study, and he
studied not only carefully but intelligently. His military
education, his actual service in the war, his taste for military
studies, the position which he held on Pillow’s staff,
and his very decided ability fitted him peculiarly to be the
military historian of the war. In order to write his history he
obtained a protracted leave of absence, and devoted himself
faithfully to his work. That he was prejudiced against both
Gen. Scott and Gen. Taylor, and criticizes both of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
eminent soldiers too severely, and very unjustly, is true,
but he tells the story of the campaign with singular fidelity
and in a masterly way. He understood what was done and
has told it in a style worthy of the great deeds which he
narrates. His obstinate temper, his prejudice, and his contentious
spirit are too often apparent, but we pardon them
in reading his luminous account of the many intricate movements
of the troops, and the wonderful battles which were
fought in the Valley of Mexico. However unjust his criticisms,
they are always able and dignified, and compel our
respect.</p>

<p>It is not strange that he did not appreciate the romantic performances
of Kearney and Doniphan and Fremont, for he
viewed all things as one fresh from the Military Academy,
where are taught the duties of a soldier, not those of a
statesman, and he was still a youth of 26 when he wrote his
history. He could not understand the meaning of Kearney’s
long march across the desert, of Doniphan’s wonderful expedition,
or of Fremont’s daring exploits and strange adventures.
He did not see that statesmen had duties more important than
those of the soldier, and that Doniphan and Kearney and
Fremont were adding an empire to the Union, while Scott
and Taylor were covering our armies with undying glory and
securing the possession of the conquests which our little armies
were making in New Mexico and California.</p>

<p>A soldier of distinction, (Stevens,) in reviewing the book,
says: “The work is professedly critical, and much space is
devoted to the discussion of the political and military movements
of both Mexico and the United States. A very thorough
exposition has been made of both campaigns and of battles.
The style is decidedly good. His view of the origin of the war
is eminently just and told in sufficient detail.”</p>

<p>The freedom with which he, a mere subaltern, criticizes
the conduct of such veterans as Scott and Taylor, both of
them his superior officers, and one of them the President<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Army,
is remarkable.</p>

<p>After commenting on Taylor’s mistakes at Palo Alto and
criticizing severely his movement upon Monterey, he denounces
his generalship in that battle and the armistice which followed.
As to Buena Vista, he evidently thinks that it was won in spite
of Taylor, and he says that the battle was saved once by the
brilliant courage and hard fighting of Davis’s Mississippi regiment,
and again by the timely and splendid execution of
Bragg’s battery; that Davis suggested his own movement,
and that Bragg moved without orders in the direction of the
plateau, and both came in at the proper hour, and were both
successful—giving fresh proof of the “supremacy of fortune in
war.”</p>

<p>His criticisms of Scott are intensely bitter, and he says that
the first great cause of American success in the operations
around the City of Mexico lay in the bravery and courage of
the army, and not in the ability and skill of the General-in-Chief,
who (in our author’s opinion) gave more attention to
politics and his own personal position than to the operations
of the war.</p>

<p>Santa Anna is skillfully and ably portrayed, and appears as
the most remarkable figure on either side. Ripley charges that
Scott was successfully duped by the Mexican from the outset
of his movement from Puebla till the capture of the city.</p>

<p>With all its faults, this book of Ripley’s is the very best
history of the war with Mexico that has been written, and it
will probably always remain the standard military history of
the war, as Kinglake’s is of the Crimean contest, and Napier’s
of the Peninsular War—the two military histories of surpassing
excellence. Its author, who is still alive and in the
perfection of his powers, ought to revise it by the light of subsequent
events, and leave it to his country as an imperishable
record of the most glorious war which the Union has ever
fought.</p>

<p class="p2 hang">THE MEXICAN WAR: A History of its Origin, with a detailed Account of its
Victories, which terminated in the Surrender of the Capital, with Official
Despatches of the Generals. By Edward D. Mansfield, a graduate of the
United States Military Academy. Illustrated with Maps and Engravings.
New York. 1848. 12mo, 343 pages.</p>
</div>

<p>This author was born in Connecticut in 1801. His father
afterwards became the first Professor of Natural Philosophy at
West Point, and there the son graduated in 1819. Declining
a commission in the Corps of Engineers, he resumed his studies
at Princeton and graduated there in 1822. He then practiced
law in Connecticut, whence he removed to Cincinnati, and
practiced law there till 1836, when he abandoned law for
literature.</p>

<p>The little volume before us gives a succinct but clear account
of the origin of the war, and of the campaigns under Taylor
and Scott, based chiefly upon the reports of those officers and
other official documents. It must be remembered, however,
that this, and indeed, every other history of the war, was published
immediately after the establishment of peace, and without
that knowledge of thousands of important facts which have
since come to light and which is essential to a correct understanding
of the diplomatic, political, and military history of
that period. Therefore, this, like all other histories of the
war written about that time, is necessarily imperfect and untrustworthy.</p>

<p>The chief defects in Mansfield’s book spring from several
facts. 1st. He was vehemently opposed to the annexation of
Texas, and to the acquisition of territory. 2d. He was a warm
partisan of Gen. Scott, whose biographer he became. 3d. His
style was intensely florid, as will appear from the last paragraph
of his book, which we quote. Speaking of the United
States and Mexico, he says: “Egypt and her millions, with
the famed Valley of the Nile, fade before the broad magnificence,
the mighty growth, of those American empires. Even
the terrible and far-seeing eagles of Rome grow dizzy and dim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
in their sight as they look down from the summits of history
upon these continental nations, these colossal giants of the
modern world. And now this Spaniard and this Northman
meet in battle panoply in this valley of volcanoes, by the ancient
groves of unknown nations, on the lava-covered soil
where nature once poured forth her awe-inspiring flames and
the brave Tlascalan once sung of glory and of greatness.
Three centuries since, these warrior nations had left their
homes beyond the wide Atlantic; two thousand miles from
each other they had planted the seats of their empire; and
now, as if time, in the moral world, had completed another
of its grand revolutions, they have met in mortal conflict.
Like the eagle and the vulture, who long had pursued different
circles in the heavens, and long made prey of the weak
tenants of the air, their circles have been enlarged till
they cross each other. They shriek! They fight! The victorious
eagle bears the vulture to the earth, and screams forth
through the clouds his triumphant song! Has the bold bird
received no wound? Has no blood tinged the feathers of
his wing? Is there no secret flow of life from the portals of
his heart? Will he continue to look with unblenched eye on
the blazing glories of the sun?”</p>

<p class="p2 hang">THE WAR BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO. Illustrated.
Embracing Pictorial Drawings of all the Principal Conflicts. By Carl Nebel.
With a Description of each Battle by George Wilkins Kendall. D. Appleton
&amp; Co. New York. 1851.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a large royal folio volume, with twelve full-page
colored lithographs, speaking of which the author and the artist
say that “no country can claim that its battles have been illustrated
in a richer, more faithful, or more costly style of lithography.”</p>

<p>The author of this book was a native of Vermont, but
moved to New Orleans in 1835, and became widely known as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the editor of the <cite>Picayune</cite>. He was a man of adventurous disposition
and decided ability, and wrote prior to the war several
books which acquired great popularity. At the outbreak of the
Mexican War he volunteered to serve on the staff of Gen. Taylor.
He was with that officer throughout his campaigns, and
afterwards accompanied Gen. Scott’s column on its march to
the City of Mexico. He was consequently an eye-witness of
the scenes which he describes. His descriptions are vivid and
real, and place him high in the ranks of war correspondents.
His book, though hardly deserving a place among histories,
will always be a rich storehouse from which historians will
gather materials for their more pretentious and more lasting
works. He was a brilliant correspondent, and, strange to say,
a truthful story-teller.</p>

<p>Mr. Nebel’s illustrations are valuable as truthful pictures of
the costumes of the contending armies, and of the scenes
which they illustrate, but, like all battle pictures, they are
highly imaginative.</p>

<p class="p2 hang">A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE MEXICAN WAR—ITS CAUSES, CONDUCT
AND CONSEQUENCES: Comprising an Account of the various Military and
Naval Operations, from its Commencement to the Treaty of Peace. Illustrated
and explained by Maps, Plans of Battles, Views and Portraits. By Nathan C.
Brooks, A. M., Member of the Maryland Historical Society, etc. Philadelphia.
1849. 8vo, 558 pages.</p>
</div>

<p>This handsome volume is the best general history of the
Mexican War, far better than any of them with the exception
of Ripley’s, which is in some particulars, and especially as a
military history, very much better than Brooks’s and all other
histories of this war. Mr. Brooks, brought to the work qualifications
and experience which fitted him particularly to write
charmingly the story of a romantic war. He was in the prime
of a life which had been passed among books; had been a
teacher and journalist; had edited gracefully and learnedly a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
series of Greek and Latin classics; was a student, historian,
and poet. His judgment was impartial and his taste refined
and highly cultivated. He was a believer in the manifest destiny
of his country, and sympathized earnestly with those who
sought to benefit mankind by enlarging “the area of freedom.”
His heart was with the armies which had marched towards the
“Halls of the Montezumas,” and he studied the reports of their
campaigns, not only eagerly, but faithfully and intelligently—by
the light of a student’s knowledge and the inspiration of
a highly poetic fancy.</p>

<p>Written at a time when but a tithe of the material which
now awaits the historian’s plastic hand was before him; when
the great mass of state papers, memoirs and reminiscences
which disclose the truth as to the negotiations which preceded
the annexation of Texas and the initiation of the war, as well
as the events of the conflict itself, were still unpublished and
inaccessible; when absolutely nothing was known to us of the
negotiations of the Mexican Government except through its
correspondence with ours, and when nothing had been ascertained
of its military operations except as disclosed upon the
battlefield—it is not to be wondered that Mr. Brooks’s history
is characterized as being more interesting and attractive than
accurate and instructive, since he neither fully understood the
great events which he was narrating nor foresaw the great consequences
which were to flow from them; nor, moreover, had
he learned the lessons which they taught, by which this generation
will profit.</p>

<p>The fault which we find with his book is one common to all
histories, not strictly military, which treat of wars that have
just happened; we refer to its extremely prolix descriptions
of battles. The reader, however, can pass over such parts of
these as do not interest him, and will lose little save the
noise and fury of the fights and the lurid phrases which describe
them.</p>

<p>The most felicitous chapters of the book are those which tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the story of the conquest of New Mexico and California, and
of Doniphan’s romantic expedition. To tell these stories well
and truly the historian needed all his poetic fancy, and all that
rich and exuberant diction with which nature and study had
so bountifully endowed him. These chapters recall the pictured
pages of Prescott, and are not unworthy of the historian
of the Conquest.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2 hang">PICTORIAL HISTORY OF MEXICO AND THE MEXICAN WAR: Comprising
an Account of the Ancient Aztec Empire, the Conquest by Cortez, Mexico under
the Spaniards, the Mexican Revolution, the Republic, the Texan War, and the
recent War with the United States. By John Frost, L.L.D., author of the
Pictorial History of the World, etc. Embellished with 500 Engravings of W.
Croome and other distinguished Artists. 8vo. Philadelphia. 1856.</p>
</div>

<p>Nearly five hundred pages of this volume are devoted to
the Mexican War. The author, who was born in Maine in
1800, studied at Bowdoin, and then at Harvard, where he
graduated in 1822. He then taught school, first at Boston
and afterwards at Philadelphia, till 1845. After that time he
gave himself up exclusively to the compilation of his many
pictorial histories, all of which achieved great popularity, and
deserved it.</p>

<p>His intention seemed always to be to write readable and
saleable books. To do this he was well fitted by his predilection
for historical composition, and his great experience as a
teacher. His style was natural and simple and perspicuous.
The arrangement of his subject was orderly, and there was in
his grouping of facts a picturesqueness which was somewhat
fascinating and always pleasing. He was not a philosopher,
or an erudite historian, nor did he pretend to be either—hence
we are not to look in his works for any profound thoughts, or
for any facts which are not the common property of every one.</p>

<p>He had no prejudices, no enthusiasms, no theories to maintain,
no heroes to exalt and magnify. He wrote to please and
to sell—to please that he might sell. Taking the official<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
reports of battle and the state papers at Washington, he drew
from them an intelligible statement of the main facts which
he intended to narrate, and then, with good taste and consummate
skill, made the dry details interesting and indeed
captivating by weaving among them stories of American
prowess, and such heroic deeds and patriotic daring as were
easily found in the letters of war correspondents and hero-worshipers.
He also availed himself of the multitude of
memoirs and books of adventure which flooded the country
immediately after the war, and thus made his book partake of
that patriotic fervor which the splendid achievements of our
troops in Mexico had kindled in the heart of every American.
He has thrown into it the charm that lingers in the wonderful
stories of Herodotus. Had he not done this, his book would
have remained unsold on the shelves of his publishers, and
would not have taken its place in every household by the side
of Parson Weem’s veracious chronicles and “The Tales of a
Grandfather.”</p>

<p>It follows from what has been said that Frost’s work on the
Mexican War is not a book for the students of either military
or diplomatic history, nor for those who wish to learn the true
history of the war, or the real truth as to the deeds which were
then done, or, as to the men who did them, what manner
of men they were, and what their motives, nor, lastly, as to the
mighty results of the contest. Nevertheless, it is a good book
and well worth a reading by those who want merely an intelligible
and interesting account of the events which it narrates.</p>

<p>It would hardly be fair to dismiss the book without referring
to the 500 engravings wherewith it is “embellished from
designs of W. Croome and other distinguished artists” whose
invaluable services Mr. Frost gratefully acknowledges. They
are simply wonderful. We open, by hazard, at page 458.
Before us is a picture of Fremont in his famous ride from Los
Angeles “to Monterey and back; a journey of more than 800
miles, performed in eight days, including two days’ detention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
and all stoppages.” This is more than 130 miles in a day.
Look at the splendid charger whose flowing mane and mud-tossed
tail and flying form brings to mind the magic horses of
the “Arabian Nights”! See how he skims over the plains, disdaining
to touch the earth with his hoofs! And see how erect
the rider sits upon his flying steed, riding night and day
through the trackless plains, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en grande tenue</i>, not a speck
of dirt on his gold-embroidered, epauletted coat of blue; not a
trace of the soil upon his immaculate trousers; not a sign of
fatigue upon the earnest face which the three-cornered hat protects
from sun and storm; nor any weariness in the stalwart
arm, whose gloved hand carries a naked sword, holding it
in strict conformity to Army regulations! Look and wonder!
Certainly, this is further beyond our criticism than are the
glowing canvases whereon Horace Vernet has immortalized the
fields of French glory.</p>

<p>The literature of the war, as has been before remarked,
is devoid of any novels of distinguished merit, and has not
been rich in poetic inspiration. But during the period of hostilities,
and amidst the political excitement that followed, James
Russell Lowell began in a leading Boston paper a series of political
satires on the war, in the Yankee dialect, purporting to be
written by Hosea Biglow. These satires were afterwards collected
in a volume with Lowell’s works, and are known as the
“Biglow Papers.” Their wit and vigor are admirable. The
character of Parson Wilbur, to whom is attributed the introduction,
notes and index, is a comic creation full of delight.
The whole is a rare repository of fun, and Hosea is the embodiment
of the native humor and homely mother wit of the
Yankee race. It is one of the most ingenious and well sustained
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</i> in existence. It is perhaps not too much
to say that it is the best burlesque poem that has appeared
since Samuel Butler, in the first part of “Hudibras,” ridiculed
the austerities of the Puritan leaders of the seventeenth century
with his shining and merciless wit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>By far the most brilliant poetic production of the period is the
elegiac ode, by Theodore O’Hara, a poet, soldier and editor, of
Kentucky. It is entitled the “Bivouac of the Dead,” and had
its origin in the occasion of the interment, at Frankfort, in
1847, of the gallant soldiers who fell in battle. It is noted for
its rare beauty of style, its genuine pathos, its descriptive
ideality, its heroic vigor, and its patriotic fervor. Genuine
appreciation and candid criticism will place it with Wolfe’s
“Burial of Sir John Moore” and Collins’s “How Sleep the
Brave,” among the classic lyric gems of the language. Its lines
are used for inscriptions upon the tombs of heroes all over the
land, and one of its immortal stanzas adorns the National
Cemetery at Arlington Heights. It goes to the heart of every
true soldier, and is likely to remain enshrined there forever.
Mention must also be made of the admiration which lingers
about the pensive beauty, the pathetic grace, and the vivid
picture of Whittier’s “Angels of Buena Vista.”</p>

<p>The excitement in the public mind occasioned by the war
caused many remarkable discussions, and the pulpit of New
England, with its usual disposition to intermeddle in political
affairs, was not tardy in presenting its opinions. The most
distinguished preacher of the time, Theodore Parker, in
words of burning eloquence denounced all wars, and the
injustice of this one, and with elaborate figures estimated its
cost and expenses at two hundred millions of dollars, and,
weighing this sum against the value of our acquisition, pronounced
the war profitless, and asked, contemptuously, “What
have we got to show for all this money?”</p>

<p>In the light of the present hour, the mere beginning that
has been made in the development of the acquired regions
will afford a partial answer to illustrate the lack of historic
prescience that blinded the perceptions of the time. The
growth of these new countries seems to point to a period,
not far distant, when they shall contain a population as
great as that which inhabits the Cis-Mississippi States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>The new apportionment bill which has just been enacted
gives to the States already erected in this region almost as
many Representatives in Congress as all New England, and
another decade will show that it has passed far in advance in
wealth and population. California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Colorado, and Utah from their mines alone have added
more than two thousand millions of dollars to the world’s
wealth, and are now yielding more than one-third of the
annual product of gold and silver in the entire world.
Two Pacific railways, the greatest feats of modern engineering,
traversing the regions that were said to be “occupied with
broken mountains and dreary wilds,” and “fit only for the
restless hunter and wandering trapper,” have revolutionized
the commerce of the world. England seeks Australia and
New Zealand through the Golden Gate, and the productions of
China and Japan flow to our magnificent harbors of the
Pacific and cross the American continent on their way to
supply the demands of Europe.</p>

<p>The archæological discoveries in these regions disclose a prehistoric
occupancy by a race that founded great cities and built
palaces and temples, and who shall say, that, under the
dominion of the Anglo Saxon, the glories of their antiquity
may not be surpassed? Who shall say what mighty results
shall flow from the contest which began when Gen. Taylor
crossed the Nueces in the march to the Rio Grande?</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
